# Preface

At the time of writing, I'm currently a college student with relatively little experience. The learning goal of this project is to prepare myself for my upcoming internship by using different frameworks and languages (React, Ruby, Rails, and GraphQL) as well as practicing my written communication. Due to the exploratory approach and my lack of experience, beware that my code may not make the best use of the frameworks or maximize efficiency.

This write-up is most similar to a journal entry rather than a tutorial or a textbook. 

# Things I've Learned

## Transpilers

> - **ECMAScript**:  the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.
> - **JavaScript ES6**: the version of Javascript that is based on the 2015 version of ECMAScript.

New versions of JavaScipt offer new syntax and features. This can lead to some compatibility issues when different browsers do not yet support a version of JavaScript. **Transpilers** solve this issue by translating incompatible Javascript code into compatible Javascript code from a version the browser supports.
