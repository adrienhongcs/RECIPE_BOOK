# Preface

At the time of writing, I'm currently a college student with relatively little experience. The learning goal of this project is to prepare myself for my upcoming internship by using different frameworks and languages (React, Ruby, Rails, and GraphQL) as well as practicing my written communication. Due to the exploratory approach and my lack of experience, beware that my code may not make the best use of the frameworks or maximize efficiency.

This write-up is most similar to a journal entry rather than a tutorial or "textbook"-like explainers.
